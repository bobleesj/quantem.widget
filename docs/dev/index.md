# Developer Guide

Everything you need to set up, understand, and contribute to `quantem.widget`.

Each widget has a Python backend (data processing, GPU computation) and a
JavaScript frontend (rendering, user interaction), connected by
[anywidget](https://anywidget.dev).

For contributing to the core `quantem` library, see
[ophusgroup/dev](https://github.com/ophusgroup/dev).
